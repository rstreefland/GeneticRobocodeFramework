# GeneticRobocodeFramework
Robocode genetic algorithm framework and robots created for the Evolutionary Computation module at the University of Reading. I'm willing to share my project report and documentation to interested parties on a case by case basis. Please email me at rhysaled.streefland@ntlworld.com if you'd like a copy.

## Information
The IntelliJ Project containing all the source code is provided in the GARobocode directory.

The bot that evolved the most generalised behaviour is provided in the EvoTank_RhysStreefland folder. 
The bot is provided as a directory (gabot) that can simply be copied into the Robocode robots directory. 

Packaging the robot as a JAR archive was not possible because the robot reads its evolved behaviour from a datafile.
